Programming 3 course - Assigments

All assigments are made in C++ (CodeBlocks and Visual Studio 2019)

Assigment 1 - Program enrypts/decrypts a message using Vigenère squar. For encryption, the password is aligned with the text. Encryption is done character
              by character using the Vigenère square. The column is specified by the character from the original text and the row is specified by the corresponding character
              from the password.
              
Assigment 2 - I created a custom Doubly Linked List with pointers that has additional methods like 
              put() - Inserts a new element at the beginning of the list
              get() - Removes an item (if possible) from the end of the list and passes it through the reference
              isEmpty() - Checks if the list is empty
              initializeDList() - Initialization of an empty list

Assigment 3 - Program that uses .txt files as a database. Program has 2 classes Article and Stock with some attributes.
              Information is read from the txt file and inserted into the objects, some calculations are performed and then output information is
              printed out in another txt file
